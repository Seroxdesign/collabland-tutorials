# collabland-tutorials/token-gating-website

This tutorial demonstrates how to build a token gating website with Collab.Land APIs.

## Run the site locally

You will need to register an API key to access this Collab.Land endpoint. Also noticed that this endpoint requires specific scope (`token-gating`).

Include the API key in `.env` file then run:

```
yarn install
yarn run build
yarn run start
```
